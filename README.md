# void_detection

We use several famous machine learning models to detect the void defect of train rails. We use one unsupervised model --- KernelPCA, and four supervised models --- Logistic Regression, SVM, AdaBoost, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
We provide the code to generate the datasets, train and evaluate the models in this folder. We also present the results of our experiments, including the mean accuracy and the area under roc curve for each model.
